    # This is composed of two elements - an "if" clause with a limited set of operators,
    # and a URL to display on a binary overview if the if clause matches.
    #
    # An if statement is able to check against either the summary of a file or features.
    #
    # Valid operators are:
    # - eq - case sensitive match against the "match" field.
    # - regex - regex match, regex specified in the "match" field.
    # - exists - if the field exists. No additional field.
    #
    # The URL is formatted with any number of arguments that you specify, also sourced
    # from a binaries summary or features. Each argument is specified with {}.

    # Both if search queries and URL arguments traverse arrays & objects and will return
    # the first hit if one is found.

    # The "if" clause and url arguments are independent.
